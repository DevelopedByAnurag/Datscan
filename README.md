 SC  => SCRAPPING AND                
 AN  => analyser 

And can also be used for data predictive modeling with the help of some of its modules 

### In simple terms 
It is a CMS for data Analysis with the mission to provide all the data analysis solutions in reach to everyone and anyone for free it has the target to able to do 95% task that we can do with help of data analysis by the end of 2k19. As being such a big project and solving such a big problem of providing solutions of data science in reach of everyone with the need of coding or even without the need of any programming language.It is a task that can't be done by anyone so here we are going to use the appoch used by the most used CMS (WORDPRESS) where all the task can be done with the help of modules which can even be developed by public and for both free and paid versions can be built as per the developers(module developer) wish. as being in beta stage we are accepting just limited entries so for details you can contact datscan@myedukit.com

Our mission is to develop a open-source platform to provide the power of data analysis and machine learning to everyone around the globe üåê for free.
